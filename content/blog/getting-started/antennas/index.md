## Antennas Are Half Of The Equation
Your transceiver won't work without an Antenna. This post isn't going to scratch the surface of amateur radio antennas but I hope it helps you to get on the air. While researching my first antenna I read a number of posts that suggested you build your first antenna. I did, and it was worth it. You can read about antennas all day but building your own really helps the pieces fall into place.
 
## SWR
You will no doubt encounter Standing Wave Ratio (SWR) values as you investigate antennas. SWR is the ratio of energy that is reflected back to your transceiver. In a perfect world an antenna's SWR would be 1:1. Generally the value is expressed as only the first number. Values below 2 are preferred. High SWR values can damage your transceiver during transmission so make sure you understand what it is and how to measure it. Modern transceivers have built-in SWR meters. My FT-891 needs to be set to 5 watts to measure SWR. If you turn your power down the chances of damaging your rig are greatly reduced.
 
### How To Measure SWR
Antenna analyzers measure SWR and can get expensive. When you are trying to build out your shack it can be a hard pill to swallow. You can rely on your transceiver, or ask your local club if they have one you can borrow. Some antenna tuners also have SWR meters. I would recommend using whatever is available and try to get by spending as little as possible so you can use the funds elsewhere.
 
[Rig Expert](https://www.dxengineering.com/search/brand/rigexpert?SortBy=Default&SortOrder=Ascending&keyword=rigexpert&kr=rigexpert) is a popular choice and [NanoVNA](https://www.amazon.com/%E3%80%90Upgraded%E3%80%91AURSINC-Analyzer-Measuring-Parameters-Standing/dp/B07Z5VY7B6/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=hsEhU&pf_rd_p=29505bbf-38bd-47ef-8224-a5dd0cda2bae&pf_rd_r=3D63BW5WDY265FXJGR0V&pd_rd_r=d6f40eed-0d0e-4621-92e8-b979b0b8a087&pd_rd_wg=xCiCF&ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_atf_m) vector network analyzers can measure SWR and provide some eye candy. I have not invested in any type of analyzer yet and rely on my antenna tuner.
## Antenna Tuners
Antenna tuners are not necessary but are nice to have. You will probably end up owning one if you keep at it long enough. Antenna tuners don't actually tune your antenna they do match the impedance of the antenna to optimize performance. Tuners should be chosen based on how you plan to operate. For [POTA](https://parksontheair.com/) and mobile operation you should consider the portability and power needs of the tuner.
 
## Building A Dipole
In the interest of just getting on the air I would suggest building a dipole. You can get a functional antenna that hangs from a tree with mateirals found at your local hardware store. Im not going to cover building the dipole in detail since there is already plenty of material out there.
 
Why a dipole? Its cheap and easy, doesn't require a tuner or a [balun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balun), and they are very effective. I followed the following video and modified it slightly to deal with the challenges I faced.

The range of your dipole will be based on the length of the wire. There are plenty of online [dipole calculators](http://www.westmountainradio.com/antenna_calculator.php) to help you determine wire length. Make sure to target the phone portion of the band. The 20 meter band is incredibly popular and requires a reasonably sized dipole but is generally only available during the day.
 
To hook up to my coax I used this SMA Male to SO-239 female connector. You could use a [BNC Male to Banana](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TC1L8RP/?coliid=I29POD4DV8WP7B&colid=WJ4GCSVOEMJI&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) if you don't have a soldering iron.

A [fan dipole](https://www.hamuniverse.com/multidipole.html) will provide access to multiple bands. Fan dipoles don't require an antenna tuner, but based on the bands you choose you may need to get the dipole high into the air since frequencies lower that 20 meter will need long wire lengths to operate.

Once your dipole is complete hang it as high as you can from a tree and test it out. If you measure less than desirable SWR trim the ends 1/4" inch at a time and try again. Be patient! Its easier to trim a little at a time that it is to add length back.
 
## Get On The Air
Thats it. Antennas are a huge subject but with little work you can make some contacts and learn as you go. I did end up buying a end-fed sloper to use for [POTA](https://parksontheair.com/) activations. The end-fed covers multiple bands and does not require a tuner for the most popular POTA bands - 20 & 40 meter. Stay focused and don't get distracted by the huge world of antennas. Get that dipole up in a tree and get on the air!
