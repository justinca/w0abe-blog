>“Perfection is the enemy of progress.” — Winston Churchill

## Step One
Coming into ham radio completly blind can be overwhelming. My goal was to get on the air as quickly as possible in 3 steps:

1. Listen to as many bands as possible (no license required)
2. Make contact on the repeaters (VHF/UHF)
3. Make contact on High Frequency (HF)

You're job is to stay focused on getting on the air. **Don't go out and buy a bunch of equipment**. Ultimately my initial gear purchases happened over the course of a few months: [SDR Play](https://www.sdrplay.com/) --> Baofeng --> Yaesu FT-891. The gear aligned with my initial goals, and aside from antennas, should get me by for awhile before I need to upgrade.

The SDR play allowed me to listen to HF/VHF/UHF all for about $100. The Baofeng is not a favorite of the ham radio world, but its cheap and acessible. The Yaesu was my last purchase and is mobile but robust enough for digital modes.

This isn't a step-by-step guide. But I did try to stuff as much useful info in here as possible for anyone that is starting at step one.
